# Budget-App
CRUD app built around budgeting using React JS and HTML/CSS

Hey! This is a CRUD application built around budgeting using various concepts like custom hooks,context API, useref and other React JS components. 
This app has it all from adding, viewing and removing expenses, even with dealing with uncategorized expenses totals to creating budgets. So a pretty involved application.
I have made it entirely using React and for styling I am using REACT BOOTSTRAP.


Thanks.
